# BobbyBigBot
A discord bot with attitude :)

Bobby Big Bot was created to enforce the specific rules of my Discord server, but I think provides a good framework for any server. To use him in your own server, download or clone the repo and create a file called `.env` in which you will add one line that looks like: 

```TOKEN=HASHCODE```

where hashcode is your bot's identifier.
